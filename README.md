Server Shield v1.1.2
=============

Server Shield is a lightweight method of protecting and hardening your Linux server. It is
easy to install, hard to mess up, and makes your server instantly and effortlessly resistant
to many basic and advanced attacks.

Automatic security updates are enabled by default, including the self-updating of Server Shield.
If you are running a modified version of Server Shield you should turn self-updating off so
your changes don't get overwritten.
