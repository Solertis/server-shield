Server Shield v1.1.5
=============

Server Shield is a lightweight method of protecting and hardening your Linux server. It is
easy to install, hard to mess up, and makes your server instantly and effortlessly resistant
to many basic and advanced attacks.

All IP addresses will be automatically detected and used for the firewall configuration.
Automatic security updates are enabled by default.

If you are running a modified version of Server Shield you should keep the self-updating of Server Shield off, so
your changes don't get overwritten.
